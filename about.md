# About Me

I'm a Product Design generalist working in the enterpreise SAAS space. I like to make things as simple as possible but also realize enterprise products are complex! The challenge is to have enough exposition to create confidence and understanding. (Presenting complexity without implying, and soon demonstrating the value, is just noise.)

My design process involves understanding customer and business goals via discussions and sketching out ideas with product owners. I then prototype, test and iterate based on feedback. I love discussing and testing with customers. Things I check for: is this useful, usable, understandable, accessible? I collaborate closely with Engineering and QA to build and test, then validate production versions with customers. Design isn't done until customers are getting their jobs done.
