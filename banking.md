# Open Banking demo site

The Open Banking demo site was kind of like a side project within the greater Axway org. It was created by a small, collaborative, and cross-functional team led by Eyal Sivan (Mr Open Banking) and I was tapped to be the designer. The site features real APIs but with a made-up, representative bank. Out of the banks that have seen the site demo so far, 5 out of 5 orgs have signed up for an Open Banking POC using the front and back end that we built (but they'll be adding their own bank name and branding).

Here's one of my [prototypes](https://xd.adobe.com/view/f563be56-c612-4848-8e16-34dfbe7d43cb-a030/) used to create the site. I worked with the dev team to translate these designs into a Joomla template.
